Hi!  
This is the github page for my personal website. Have a [look](https://manansoni42.github.io/).  
It is built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - A simple blog-aware static site generator. You can use it to generate your own local website in minutes. It is also very well integrated with github and you can have your website up and running in no time!  
I use the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme along with my own modifications.
