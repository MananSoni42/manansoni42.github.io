I am a coodardy[^footnote] programmer captivated by the beauty of Mathematics. On a mission to make machines intelligent so that I can finally sleep in peace. Check out some of my _cooler_ projects [here](https://manansoni42.github.io/tags/cool/)!
<hr>

I am a third-year student at BITS Pilani pursuing a dual degree (bachelor's in Computer Science along with a master's in Mathematics). A huge Linux fan along with Vim (Have you tried [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/)?). I love reading novels ([HG2G](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386162.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) anyone?), playing Table Tennis, watching (and playing) Cricket. I can also solve the Rubik's cube.

I was always fascinated by the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  
Armed with a basic understanding of Linear Algebra and Statistics, I started exploring Machine Learning in the winter vacations after my first year. I learned the basics (from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)). Over the next year, I did projects ranging from [Recommending movies]({%post_url 2018-07-03-Movie-Recommendations%}) and [Detecting diseases in plants]({%post_url 2020-05-25-CV-SoP%}) to [improving public transport]({%post_url 2019-08-25-NEC-GA%}) and [generating new passages from my favourite novel]({%post_url 2020-05-10-New-HG2G%}). It was a fun journey!  
In my fifth semester, during a course on Optimization, I was introduced to Genetic Algorithms. I was mesmerized by the idea and delved into the world of Genetic Algorithms. One thing led to another, and I found myself reading [Reinforcement Learning -  An introduction](https://www.amazon.in/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Richard-Sutton/dp/0262039249ref=sr_1_1?crid=GPAZTB1BEUCA&dchild=1&keywords=sutton+and+barto&qid=1590264242&sprefix=sutton+and+%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-1). Lately, I have been reading more about Reinforcement Learning and spend my free time training computers to play some of my childhood games (like [snake](https://manansoni42.github.io/reinforcement-learning/snake/web/game.html)).
