## About the problem
This is my solution for [CS50's project 1 - Books](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/1/project1.html).
This project was started after watching the first 5 lectures. So all I really knew at this point was the basics of HTML, CSS and Flask. Along with a basic idea of how to work with databases.
> Note that I did not know JavaScript at this point. Some features of the website could have been a lot better if I had known JS.

## Implementation and features
* Log in / Sign up - The server will remember you and your preferences
* Contains 5000 pre-loaded books
* Accesses the summary, photos and ratings of any book using the [GoodReads API](https://www.goodreads.com/api).
* You can add books to your personal library to access later. Also, books added to your personal library are automatically marked as read.
* search for books using the search bar.

## Some common problems
Since this was my first attempt at making a website, I did lots of stuff wrong. But some of the problems were also solved creatively using the limited tools at my disposal. Here are a few of them:
* The total number of books is constant - I only have support for 5000 books for now.
* The server caches image URLs as it sees them.  But, loading the page for the first time is time-consuming and often takes 3-4 minutes (The home page has ~50 books). Subsequent visits are much faster.
* A lot of pages are reloaded completely when only a small part of the page changes. For example, when you click on a book, the summary and reviews should be rendered as tabs in a single static page, but they are separate pages. (This is difficult to achieve without JavaScript though).
* In the reviews sections, the icon for stars needed to be generated dynamically (based on the actual rating). This was difficult to do with HTML and CSS, but I managed to generate HTML code for these stars on the server and sent it along while rendering the page and it worked like a charm!
* The database password and your app's secret is easily exposed in the server code. Consider use environment variables to improve its security

## Installing
### Requirements
* Python 3
* pip
* PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy)

### Installing python dependencies using pip
Once you have installed the requirements, install all the dependencies using
```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```  
### Setting up a PostgreSQL database
* Set up a PostgreSQL server on your local server and configure it. [This](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-18-04) tutorial might help.  
> Note your name and password.  

* Create a db with the your name (dbname)
* Now once you have created an account navigate to ```server.py``` and ```reset_db.py```, modify the DATABASE URI and replace \<name\>, \<password\> and \<dbname\> accordingly:
```
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = 'postgresql://<name>:<password>@localhost/<dbname>'
```
### Populating the database with books
Run the restart_db.sh script to fill your database for the first time (You only need to do this once whenever you set up a new database).

### Running the server
You are good to go! Run the server using
```
python3 server.py
```
