## Why a blog?
Initially, this blog was just a way for me to showcase my projects. I have done a lot of projects during my college.   But, more often than nought, I start a project, I develop it to a certain extent and that's it! It is either left o incomplete and I start with something new.

So during the lockdown I decided to finally sit down and compile a list of all of my unfinished projects and FINISH them once and for all!  

While writing about these projects I realized the process was fun in itself as well. So I decided why not put these up as well? I plan to start with topics that I understand very well i.e Maths and CS

## How the blog is organized
```
├── Projects # Projects that I was able to salvage
└── Blog
    ├── General # My views about life, the universe and everything
    ├── Mathematics # Interesting Math puzzles, observations, etc
    └── Computer Science # Quirky algorithms, practical tips, etc
```
