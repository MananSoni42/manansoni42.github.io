Say hello to Flack, a messaging app that can be accessed from any device.

## About the problem
This is my solution for [CS50's project 2 - Books](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/x/projects/2/project2.html).
This project was started after watching the first 8 lectures. I chose not to use a database to simplify the codebase. This is the first time that I was exposed to SocketIO and explored a model different from the usual GET/POST requests.

## Features
* Enter your own display name when you log in for the first time, the name is saved in your cookies afterwards.
* Truly Asynchronous
  * When you add a new channel, it instantly updates on everyone's devices
  * A live count of the number of messages of each channel on the channels page
* Your messages appear on the left side of the chat page while everyone else's messages appear on the right.

## Installing
### Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* pip
### Installing Dependencies
Install the dependencies using:
```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
> Note: socketIO is known to cause a lot of issues while installation If you face any issue, check out [this issue](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/issues/652).

That's it! Run your server:
```terminal
python3 server.py
```
