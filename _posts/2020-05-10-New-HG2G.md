There's nothing as bittersweet as finishing a really great book. What do you do when you complete a great series and are left yearning for more?  
If you are like me, you train a machine to read the books and let it generate new (unseen) passages from the book!


## About the book
Let me introduce you to my favourite book - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

A sci-fi comedy unlike no other, a trilogy in five parts.  
The book is smart, funny, well-written and full of wonderful commentary on the human condition.  
Plus, the book has some of the best quotes EVER!  
Why would you not read it?

## Generating new passages
* It is trained on the first 2 books - [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386162.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) and The [Restaurant at the End of the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8695.The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe)
* Once I obtained the text version of the books, I divided the text into individual sentences.
* Each sentence was then subdivided into words (dealing with punctuation as well)
* I used the word2vec algorithm to generate word-embeddings for each word in the text's vocabulary.  
  (Word embeddings are numerical representations of contextual similarities between words)
* Generating the dataset:
  * Iterate through the entire text and divide it into overlapping, semi-redundant chunks of 31 words each. The first 30 words act as X (data) while the last word serves as the Y   
* Train an LSTM model using the X, Y datasets constructed earlier. (Note that the last layer of the LSTM model should be a softmax layer with the same size as the total number of words). Essentially, the model outputs probabilities of the next word given a sentence
* Once trained, generate a random string of exactly 30 words (preferably from the text itself) and pass it to the LSTM model, select a random word according to the probabilities given by the model. And repeat!  

**Example:** Consider the text:  
"Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea."
The X,Y pairs generated from this text are:  
<table class="table table-responsive scroll">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>X</th>
      <th>Y</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">"Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea."  </td>
      <td markdown="span">"digital"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">"this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital"</td>
      <td markdown="span">"watches"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">"at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital watches"</td>
      <td markdown="span">"are"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">"roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital watches are a pretty neat"</td>
      <td markdown="span">"idea"</td>
    </tr>

## Usage
* Visit [http://hg2g-42.herokuapp.com/](http://hg2g-42.herokuapp.com/) (it's pretty much self-explanatory)
  * The top section displays a random one-liner from the original trilogy (of 5 parts).  
  * You can enter some seed text that my model can use as a starting point (Leave it empty for an arbitrary starting sentence).  
  * The length of the generated text can also be varied (between 5-75 words).  
* Since the sampling mechanism is random, you will get different (but similar) results even for the same seed text.
* The algorithm works only on lowercase letters for simplicity. So, the case of the seed text is irrelevant   

Some good starting points (Found after hours of experimentation ;p)
* A nice cup ...
* Once again, Marvin was ...
* The heart of gold ...
* The mice ...
* The total perspective vortex ...
* The Sirius cybernetics corporation ...
