The course had exciting and useful projects that taught me a lot. Also, during the course I also did small self-projects to understand particular topics better. I have hosted these projects as static single page websites on Github.

### Static pages
* [nav](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/nav.html)(HTML,CSS) - A basic navigation bar with clickable buttons
* [box](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/box.html)(HTML,CSS) - Learning to use the CSS grid module
* [members](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/members.html)(HTML,CSS) - A generic members page for any organization
* [members-dynamic](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/members-dynamic.html)(HTML,CSS,JS(Handlebars)) - Template for a generic members page for any organization with the ability to add/delete members
* [Scroller](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/inf_scroll.html)(HTML,CSS(animation),JS) - An infinite list of posts that generates new posts as soon as you reach the bottom of the page
* [Clock](https://manansoni42.github.io/web-dev/frontend/clock.html)(HTML(SVG),CSS,JS) - An analog clock that shows your system time
