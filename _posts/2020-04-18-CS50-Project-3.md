## About the problem
This is my submission for [CS50's project 3](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/3/project3.html).
This project was started after watching all the lectures. The focus was on learning Django and mimicking the exact requirements of the customer ([Pinnochio's](http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html))

## Features
* Built using Django
* Single page responsive design - The entire menu is on a single page - No need for reloading!
* An interactive add to cart option - Choose individuals details and toppings after you choose your menu item in an interactive pop-up menu
* View the details order before placing your order from the cart

## Improvements
* There is no login system at present. The naming system is only a proxy.
* Add an option to view finished / previous orders

## Installing
### Requirements
* Python 3
* pip
* PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy)

### Installing python dependencies using pip
Once you have installed the requirements, install all the dependencies using
```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```  
### Setting up a PostgreSQL database
* Set up a PostgreSQL server on your local server and configure it. [This](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-18-04) tutorial might help.  
> Note your name and password.  

* Create a database in psql (dbname)
* Now once you have created an account navigate to ```web-dev/pizza/pizza/settings.py``` in replace \<name\>, \<password\> and \<dbname\> accordingly:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': <dbname>,
        'USER': <name>,
        'PASSWORD': <password>,
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',    }
}
```

### Populating the database with menu items
Run the following commands to populate the menu
```terminal
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py loaddata fixtures/db.json
```
### Running the server
You are good to go! Run the server using
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
> Note the port which is shown in the output of this command

### Viewing and modifying the database (using Django-admin)
To view the database records, set up a Django superuser
```terminal
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Using these credentials, you can visit the admin site by visiting:  
```
localhost:<port>/admin
```
(The default port is 8000)
