> My first math post!  
Motivation: The next time somebody says that Math is boring, you know what to say  

Our journey starts in the 1800s - we follow the journey of a violinist - Ludwig van Beethoven ...  
Wait... wrong guy.  
Meet Georg Cantor - a Mathematician (and an awesome violinist). The first mathematician to really understand the meaning of infinity and to give it mathematical precision. Cantor revolutionized Mathematics with his groundbreaking work on set theory - the following is a small excerpt of his brilliance.  
So let us follow his footsteps and explore the realm of the infinite!

## The basics - Counting
**Example**: Consider that you are in a classroom with 200 seats. The classroom is completely full. How many students does the classroom have?  
200 right?  
How did you know that without counting the students there?  
Your reasoning probably goes like this:
  * There are 200 seats
  * Each chair has exactly one student sitting on it  
  * So the number of students and the number of chair must be the same - 200
  * So, there are 200 students

What this example strives to show is that comparison is at the basis of counting. To count we first need to know how to compare. Let us define the following rule for comparing:  
**Rule:** If you have 2 sets (collection of objects) - say, A and B have the same size[^card] if:  
  * We can pair each object of A with an object of B  
  * No element (from A or B) is left out
  * Every element from A pairs with a unique element in B (and vice versa)

> Remember this rule


If only there was a way to compare to some already established standard, counting would be very easy - For any given set, find a corresponding standard set that has the same size and we are done.  
These standard sets are really easy to define:
<table class="table table-responsive">
  <tbody class="text-center">
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Standard set**</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{1\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{1, 2\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{1, 2, 3\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{1, 2, 3, ..., 42\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Size**</td>
      <td markdown="span">1</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
      <td markdown="span">3</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
      <td markdown="span">42</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Example**  
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3"></div>
  <div class="col-6 text-center">
    <img class="img-responsive rounded" src="/assets/img/blog/cantor/sheep2.jpg" alt="sheep2">
  </div>
  <div class="col-3"></div>
</div>
* How would you count the number of sheep in the above image?  
* The picture shows one possible pairing between the sheep in the picture and the standard set {1,2,3,4,5}.
* No sheep is left out and each sheep is paired with a unique number
* So the number of sheep is the same as the size of the standard set {1,2,3,4,5}
* There are 5 sheep

So now that we have a firm grasp on the basics of counting  - let's move on to something slightly more abstract.

## How would do we count the infinite?
Before counting the uncountable, let's start with a simpler question - how do we define it?  
Try it out. How would you define an infinite set?  
A few possibilities are:  
1. An infinite set is a set whose elements can not be counted.
2. An infinite set is one that has no last element.
3. An infinite set is a set that is not finite.

Cantor settled on a much subtler definition:  
A set is infinite if at least one of it's parts has the same size as itself.[^formal_def]  
(In other words, a set is infinite if we can find a pairing between the set and one of it's part that satisfies the rule we defined earlier.)

> Why use this strange definition?  
This definition is useful for 2 reasons:  
i. It uses only previously defined terms (i.e - the size of a set and the rule we defined earlier)  
ii. It is easy to check if a set is finite/infinite using it (We just need to construct a suitable pairing)  
(The earlier definitions fail in at least one of the above).

This definition should make sense intuitively.  
If a set was finite, then each part will have a size smaller than that - and thus no part has the same size.

**Example** Consider the set $$Z = \{ A, B, C\}$$  
It has a size of 3. We can verify that it is finite by checking that each part of Z has a size smaller than 3.  
<table class="table table-responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Part**</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{A\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{B\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{C\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{A,B\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{B,C\}$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">$$\{C,A\}$$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Size**</td>
      <td markdown="span">1</td>
      <td markdown="span">1</td>
      <td markdown="span">1</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Now consider an infinite set - say the counting numbers $$( 0,1,2,3,... )$$  
The even numbers $$( 0,2,4,6,... )$$ are (clearly) a part of them. Do they have the same size?  
Yes! the pairing given below maps every counting number to a unique even number. Further no number is left out.
<table class="table table-responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Counting number**</td>
      <td markdown="span">0</td>
      <td markdown="span">1</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
      <td markdown="span">3</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
      <td markdown="span">n</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Even number**</td>
      <td markdown="span">0</td>
      <td markdown="span">2</td>
      <td markdown="span">4</td>
      <td markdown="span">6</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
      <td markdown="span">2n</td>
      <td markdown="span">...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
> The pairing satisfies all the rules we defined earlier!  

That must mean that they have the same size!  
So per our definition, the counting numbers are infinite. What should we call their size?
Let us denote it by the hebrew letter $$\aleph_0$$. We have our first result:  
**The size of the counting numbers is $$\aleph_0$$.**    
## Are there more?
The next logical question is:  
Have we discovered all the possibilities i.e do all infinite sets have the same size ($$\aleph_0$$)?  
Let's try out a few examples.  

### The integers
```
Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  
```
Surely, the integers must be bigger than the counting numbers? (after all the counting numbers are a **part of** the integers)  
It turns out that they have the same size. How do we show this? we construct a pairing  
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-1"></div>
  <div class="col-10">
    <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="/assets/img/blog/cantor/NZ.jpg" alt="N-Z mapping">
  </div>
  <div class="col-1"></div>
</div>  
> Odd numbers pair with negative numbers  
Even numbers pair with positive numbers

Since our pairing covers all the integers, they must have the same size as the counting numbers
i.e The size of the integers is also $$\aleph_0$$

### The rational numbers (fractions)
```
Q = {all numbers that can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers}
  = {all numbers with a finite decimal representation}
  = {..., 1/2, 4/3, 2=(2/1), ...}
```
$$  
\mathbb{Q}=\Big\{\dfrac{p}{q} \ | \ p,q \in\mathbb{Z} \Big\} \quad \textrm{(The formally correct definition of the rational numbers)}
$$  

Surely all the fractions must be bigger than the counting numbers?  
Not only do they contain the counting numbers, but there are an **infinite** number of fractions between just the first two counting numbers!  
> 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ... n/n+1, ...  are all between 0 and 1

Strangely, this is also not true.  
Constructing a pairing between the counting numbers and the rational numbers is a bit tricky.  
One possible pairing is shown below:  
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-1"></div>
  <div class="col-10">
    <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="/assets/img/blog/cantor/rationals.png" alt="N-Q mapping">
  </div>
  <div class="col-1"></div>
</div>  
>  Just follow the arrows:  
* 1/1 is the 1st, so it pairs with 1  
* 2/1 is second so it pairs with 2
* ...  
* 2/3 is eigth so it pairs with 8
* ...  
* Cross out fractions that we already counted. So any fraction that is not in it's simplest form is crossed out.  
* 0/1 pairs with 0

**Final pairing**

    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">**Counting number**</td>

    </tr>

</table>  
So the rational numbers also have the same size - $$\aleph_0$$
> These results may appear counter-intuitive at the beginning. (you wouldn't be the only one - when Cantor first published his theory, it encountered resistance from mathematical giants of his time as well).  
But once you understand the mechanics of defining pairings, intuition follows. If you want more such examples - check out [Hilbert's hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj3_KqkI9Zo) - a brilliant thought experiment designed to help you wrap your mind around this counter-intuitive theory.

> This result in particular baffled me. There are an infinite number of fractions between any 2 counting numbers (in fact, there are an infinite number of fractions between any two fractions). And yet, they have the same size!

## Gong beyond - Cantor's brilliant proof
While exploring this particular definition of size, Cantor stumbled upon a strange result.  
He found a set bigger than the counting numbers. How could that be? The counting numbers are already infinite?

### The real numbers
```
R = { All numbers that have a (finite or infinite) decimal representaion }  
  = { All numbers that are either rational or irrational }
```
$$  
\mathbb{R} \supseteq \{-3, \frac{-1}{2},\ 0,\ 0.5,\ 1.414,\ \sqrt 2,\ \pi,\ \frac{42}{9},\ ... \}
$$[^reals]  

We shall show that the reals are bigger than the counting numbers using reductio ad absurdum (also known as a proof by contradiction).  

1. **Suppose** the size of the reals was the same as that of the counting numbers
2. There must exist a pairing between them (By definition)  
(Say, it looks like the figure below)  
> Note that this is just one possible pairing, our argument is independant of the actual pairing. It only relies on the fact that a pairing exists.  

![cantor-diag](/assets/img/blog/cantor/cantor.jpg)

3. Construct a new real number N as follows:
>
  * Go to the 1st number on the list, and look at it's 1st decimal place (2 in the diagram)  
  * Let N's 1st decimal place be any number other than 2 (say, 7) (so far N = 0.7)
  <br><br>
  * Go to the 2nd number on the list, and look at it's 2nd decimal place (9)   
  * Let N's 2nd decimal place be any number other than 9 (N = 0.74)  
  <br>
  * Carry this process forever, so in general  
  * Look at the 'm'th number on our list, specifically it's 'm'th decimal place.  
  * Choose any digit EXCEPT this one for the mth decimal place of N  
  <br>
  * Using this we get N = 0.746894310875...

4. Let us show that N does not belong to the list   
![cantor-diag-2](/assets/img/blog/cantor/cantor-2.jpg)   
> Now since N is a real number, N must be somewhere on the list.  
It can't be at the 1st place because it differs from the 1st number at the 1st decimal place  
It can't be at the 2nd place because it differs from the 2nd number at the 2nd decimal place  
...  
It can't be at the Nth place because it differs from the Nth number at the Nth decimal place  
...

5. This argument shows that N does not fit anywhere on our list[^proof]. But N is clearly a real number.  
6. So our initial assumption (that every real number can be paired with a unique counting number) must be incorrect.
7. Therefore the real numbers represent an infinte set bigger than the counting numbers. $$\quad \blacksquare$$

Such a simple proof. Yet the consequences are monumental.  
The size of the real numbers is bigger than that of the counting numbers. It is so big that when we try to fit all the real numbers in a list of counting numbers - they overflow.  
We see that not all infinite sets are the same, they have some structure in them. Instead of saying that the set of size is $$\infty$$, we can do better - we can find out whether it's size is $$\aleph_0$$ or $$\aleph_1$$.
( This is useful because sets in the same size class have some similar properties.[^prop] )  

Let us summarize, the sizes we have seen so far:  
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive">
  <thead class="text-center">
    <tr>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="text-nowrap" markdown="span">N = (1,2,3,...)</td>
      <td markdown="span">Sets with a finite number of elements</td>
      <td markdown="span">
        $$A_1 = \{ 42 \} \ \textrm{(A set with only 1 element - the number 42)}$$  
        $$A_2 = \{ \heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit, \spadesuit\} \ \textrm{(Suites in a deck of cards - 4 elements)}$$
        $$A_3 = \{ a,b,c, ..., z\} \ \textrm{(Letters of the english alphabet - 26 elements)}$$
      </td>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">$$\aleph_0$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">Sets of the first infinite kind</td>
      <td markdown="span">
        $$A_1 = \mathbb{N} = \{ 1,2,3,...\} \ \textrm{(The natural numbers)}$$   
        $$A_2 = \{ 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,...\} \ \textrm{(The odd numbers)}$$   
        $$A_3 = \{ 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...\} \ \textrm{(The prime numbers)}$$   
        $$A_4 = \mathbb{Z} = \{ ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,...\} \ \textrm{(The integers)}$$   
        $$A_5 = \mathbb{Q} = \{ ..., -4/3, -1, 0, 1/2,...\} \ \textrm{(The rational numbers)}$$   
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">$$\aleph_1$$</td>
      <td markdown="span">Sets of the second infinite kind</td>
      <td markdown="span">
        $$A_1 = \mathbb{R} \supseteq \{\frac{-1}{2},\ 0,\ 0.5,\ 1.414,\ \sqrt 2,\ \pi,\ \frac{42}{9},\ ... \} \\ \textrm{(The real numbers)}$$   
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Beyond the proof
The sizes don't end at $$\aleph_1$$. Cantor's diagonalization argument can be generalized. We can show that not only there are infinite sets, but that $$\aleph_0$$ (often known as countable infinity) is the first in an infinite[^inf_proof] hierarchy of infinite sets, each bigger than the last.   
The proof is similar to another proof that the counting numbers are infinite. An informal argument goes like:   
<table class="table table-bordered table-responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">Suppose N was the biggest counting number</td>
      <td markdown="span">Suppose A was an infinite set with the largest size</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">
        We can construct a counting number bigger than N  (
        N+1)
      </td>
      <td markdown="span">
        We can construct a set bigger in size than A  
        ( P(A) )
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">So N is not the biggest counting number</td>
      <td markdown="span">So A does not have the largest size</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span">So our initial assumption was wrong, there is no largest counting number</td>
      <td markdown="span">So our initial assumption was wrong, there is no infinite set with the largest size</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


In fact, this generates a new generalization of the Natural numbers - the cardinal numbers:  
$$
0,1,2,3,\ldots ,n,\ldots ;\aleph_{0},\aleph_{1},\aleph_{2},\ldots ,\aleph_{\alpha },\ldots
$$  
They are a valid number system and you can even do arithmetic with them!

### Filling the gaps - The Continuum hypothesis
After having discovered a hierarchy among infinite sets, Cantor sought to fill the gaps between his infinite hierarchy.  
**Cantor's hypothesis: there is a set with a size between that of the natural numbers and the real numbers.**    
Cantor tried for many years in vain to prove it. (this problem was seen as so important that it was the first of the top 23 unsolved problems in 1900).     
It took another 63 years and the efforts of 2 brilliant mathematicians (Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen) to show an astounding result - the hypothesis could neither be proved nor be disproved (in standard set theory)! The continuum hypothesis was among the first mathematical statements that was shown to be undecidable!
